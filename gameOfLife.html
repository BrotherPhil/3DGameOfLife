  <h1>Conway's Game Of Life... Now in 3D!</h1>
  <p>
    Conway's Game of life is... well it's <a href="http://www.bitstorm.org/gameoflife/">this</a>.
    Obviously, it's pretty two dimensional, and that implementation is very
    "written in java". Now there's all this fun "HTML5" stuff like canvases and
    the like, so I figure that it's about time I figure out how they work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, of course, with the extra dimension, the math will have to change.
    Experiment time!
